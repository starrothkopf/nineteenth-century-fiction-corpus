    "\n",
    "However, the key word there is \"aspires.\" We actually rely on a probabilistic model that is known to be wrong about 11% of the time. The model predicts the probability that two records are \"the same work,\" using evidence that includes the similarity of their authors and titles in metadata, but also the degree of similarity between *their texts,* as measured through cosine similarity on extracted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've set the probability threshold at 66% to be cautious about collapsing works together. So when the model makes an error it will usually (7%) go wrong by saying that two works are different, and more rarely (4%) mistakenly claim they are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** this process is not completely reproducible from this notebook alone; it involves 4GB of data about extracted features that I have not uploaded to the GitHub repo. However if you consult **../get_EF** you can see how to download and process that data yourself. Fair warning: it took ~30hrs of processing."

    "### Now the actual deduplication\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, generally, we want to take one volume from each group of volumes that have matching titles and authors. And in general we want to take the earliest volume, so our resulting dataset will be dated as close as possible to dates of first publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are complicating cases. What if, for instance, the earliest instance of a novel is a Victorian three-decker edition? That's going to happen pretty often. In that case, we don't want to take *just one volume* from the group; we want all three volumes of the earliest edition. So we need a new rule: take all volumes sharing the *recordid* of the earliest volume. That will get all three volumes of a three-volume edition.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we confront yet another complication! Volumes grouped by a recordid are sometimes three volumes of a single work. But often they are, say, 28 volumes in the *Collected Works of Scott.* All sharing a single record id, but not all the same fictional work. Maybe some of the longer novels are spread across 2 or three volumes, but many of the volumes represent a single novel. This gets bloody complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "So our *new* rule is: find the earliest volume. Get its record id. Find all volumes sharing that record id (all volumes in the same set). Then take all the volumes that share the same *short title*. If we have been able to identify vols 11 and 12 as *Ivanhoe,* this will get just 11 and 12. However, if we haven't been able to identify titles beyond *Collected Works of Scott,* we'll get all 28 vols! So the final rule is, ignore cases where we recover more than five vols sharing the same recordid. We suspect these are collected works.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we do this, we are going to want to keep track of the number of copies of a volume that have been collapsed into a single deduplicated record. We'll use a column of \"instances\" created in the earlier stage of deduplication; this counts vols that had the same recordid+volnum. We'll further aggregate that into \"copies\": vols that had the same author/title. Moreover, since we may want to distinguish *contemporary* popularity from later canonicity, we're going to keep track of this in two different ways: a general column of copies and a column of copies-published-within-25-yrs of our first example."
